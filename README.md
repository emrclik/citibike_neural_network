This project represents a deep dive into bike rental data from New York’s CitiBike system, using machine learning. With CitiBike, riders can rent publically available bikes for single rides, or subscribe for long-term access. Bike rental is an integral part of New York’s transit system, and we can glean a number of insights and make predictions based on the available data.

For marketing purposes, it would be useful to have an idea just who is riding, and where they are riding to and from. Using Python’s SciKitLearn library we built a neural network to predict whether a rider is aged 20-29 based on the other details of their ride (duration, route cluster, hour of the day, etc). The model yields 75%-85% accuracy depending on the input data.

This is a many-layered task, and this site will take you through our data cleaning process, machine learning model, and include a few other analyses that help us understand rider behavior.
